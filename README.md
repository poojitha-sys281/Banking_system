# Banking System Application

## Project Overview

The Banking System Application is a simple interactive program designed to facilitate basic banking operations, allowing users to manage their accounts effectively. This application enables clients to open new accounts, access existing accounts, manage their funds, and delete accounts as necessary. Built using Python, it incorporates object-oriented programming principles to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Problem Statement

The current banking system application offers only basic account management functionalities, lacking robust security measures for user authentication. This raises concerns about data safety and fraud prevention. An enhanced system is needed to improve user experience, strengthen security, and streamline banking operations. By addressing these issues, we aim to create a more secure and efficient banking solution for users.
